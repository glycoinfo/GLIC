# GLIC seminar series
The aim of the GLIC seminar series is to introduce and promote software tools and databases to the bioinformatics and (glyco-)biology community. If you want to learn more about GLIC please visit our [home page](https://glic.glycoinfo.org/).

<br>

## Special Topic: Glycan Array's
The webinar series on the special topic of glycan arrays will focus on tools and databases for processing, interpreting and storing glycan array data. The seminar series will start with an introduction into glycan arrays and how they can be used to study the interaction between glycans and other biological components, such as proteins, bio-fluids, lectins or micro-organism. The following webinars individual groups will present their software tools and databases and demonstrate their access and usage.

All webinars will start at 10am ET. Registration to the seminar series wil be done using EventBrite.

**Abstract**  
This first webinar will start with a short introduction into the webinar series and the individual talks. In this seminar we will provide a general overview about glycan array experiment and data processing and illustrate the use of this technique and data for the generation of new biological knowledge.

**Abstract**  
CarbArrayART (Carbohydrate microArray Analysis and Reporting Tool) is a software tool for day to day use for: (1) Recording scan data and related metadata. (2) Processing and presentation of data as tables and charts with filtering and sorting functions and (3) Reporting data compliant with MIRAGE guidelines.

**Abstract**  
GLAD is a useful tool to explore data from several glycan microarray experiments. GLAD allows you to visualize your data and compare datasets using several visualization options. It also allows for basic data wrangling such as filtering and sorting your data.

**Abstract**  
Lectins and Glycan Binding Proteins are powerful and accessible tools for glycan analysis. Despite the abundance of datasets providing glycan-binding profiles of GBPs, researchers frequently interpret GBP binding using inaccurate or incomplete definitions of GBP specificity. Here we present CarboGrove, a database of data-driven and human-readable glycan binding specificities derived from 36 different glycan array platforms for hundreds of glycan binding proteins. To enable users to readily access the binding information, the database features many options for searching and filtering the results including the ability to search by affinity to various motifs. Furthermore, glycan-binding models can be downloaded and used for the prediction of GBP to new glycans, a crucial step in experimental design and the automated interpretation of glycan binding data.
