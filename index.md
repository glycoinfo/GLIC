# Welcome to Glycoinformatics Consortium (GLIC)

The purpose of the Glycoinformatics Consortium (GLIC) is to provide a centralized source software repository for glycoscientists. In addition, it is aimed to provide a communication point for glycoscientists and glycoinformaticians.  Those who would like to join GLIC can contact us at glycoinformatics-consortium-glic@googlegroups.com.

This home page provides a list of software and databases for glycoscience research. There is also a Wish List to which scientists can contribute requests for software, tools or databases.
<!-- * Sat, 16 Oct, 2019 9:00 - 18:00(JST)(planned), GLIC SPARQL endpoint will be unavailable due to maintenance. -->
